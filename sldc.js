// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const anaylysisOfRequirements = 'during the second step the prime focus is to note the exact things need. This data is then analyzed to ensure its validity and possibilities.'
const design = 'the draft design is prepard for the software from the stage-1 requirement specifications.'
const implementation = 'after recieving the design documents fr the software to be created, the work following the design stage is divided equally into various units and modules. The main focus of the phase is the development of perfect codes by the developers. This particular phase is the longest in the entire porocol.'
const testAndIntegration = 'testing all variants of the functional testing. If anything goes wrong in the testing stage or any error is noted in the codes, it can lead to the repetition of the coding process. After all errors are removed from coding during the testing process the finalized code is implemented into the software and then deployed or delivered to the customers to be used. 
const maintain = 'Once the customers start using well-developed software, the actual issues start surfacing with time and its the teams job to fix all the bugs.'
